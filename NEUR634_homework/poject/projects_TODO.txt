### Essentials

1) Striatum LTS interneuron model *.p file.

Channels:
 1) Calcium channel -> Ca_v1 -> Reduces the amplitude of membrane potential resonance.[Block]
 2) Calcium channel ->  Ca_v2 -> Reduces the frequency of membrance potential resonance.[Block]
 3) Potassium channel ->  K 
 4) Chloride channel -> Ca_cc -> Abolishes the oscillations. [Block]

Note:

1) In depolarized state -> express 3-7Hz. [during resonance] [membrance potential]
2)
