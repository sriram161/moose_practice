### Essentials

1) Striatum LTS interneuron model *.p file.
  Able to load model into moose using moose.loadModel( file, 'model')

Channels:
 1) Calcium channel -> Ca_v1 -> Reduces the amplitude of membrane potential resonance.[Block]
 2) Calcium channel ->  Ca_v2 -> Reduces the frequency of membrance potential resonance.[Block]
 3) Potassium channel ->  K
 4) Chloride channel -> Ca_cc -> Abolishes the oscillations. [Block]

Note:

1) In depolarized state -> express 3-7Hz. [during resonance] [membrance potential]

# TODO use moose utility functions and set conductance based on geometry of compartments.

##### Question I want to ask the paper?

1) Can I reproduce the membrance oscillations that was explained in the paper?
2) Can sodium channel impact membrane oscillation?
3) How spiking activity is impacted in the presence of membrane oscillations?

###### What question is the paper trying to address?

###### What is the importance for that question?

###### Channel parameters of the model:
1) Potassium -> gmax = 0.5 mS/cm2, vhalf = -20 mV, v_slope = 4mV, Erev = -90mV Done!!!
2) Leak -> gmax = 0.06 mS/cm2 C = 1uF
3) Ca_l V1 -> gmax = 0.018 mS/cm2,vhalf= -10mV, v_slope = 15mV, Erev= 100mV Done!!!
4) Ca_N V2 -> gmax = 0.4 mS/cm2,vhalf= 10mV, v_slope = 15mV, Erev= 100mV Done!!!

5) Cl channel[Ca dependent] ->  buf = 0.6, time_constant= 200msec calcConc = 1000 uM
Note cloride channel is simillar to calcium dependent potassium channel from lecture.
