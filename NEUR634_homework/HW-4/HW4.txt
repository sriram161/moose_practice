Homework, due Sept 25:

A. Download swc file for a neuron from NeuroMorpho.org
	Read into MOOSE using loadcell command
	Create function to adjust Rm, Cm, Ra, Em, initVM for each compartment, according to your values of RM, CM ,RA, Eleak
	Done!!!

B. create .p file
	Use corticalcell.p, or find several line .p file, or create a soma and a few dendritic comportments yourself
	Donâ€™t forget to add in RM, CM, RA, Eleak and EREST_ACT
	Read into MOOSE using loadcell command

C. Run simulations (A) and (B) using
	same current injection (you choose amplitude and duration), RM, CM, RA, e.g. RM=4 ohm-m2, RA=1 ohm-m2
	Comment on whether morphology changes the response to current injection

D. NEURON simulations
	Create a soma attached to dendrite
	Connect to current injection (create function for current injection)
	Create function for recording and record from soma and middle of dendrite
	Similar to the previous MOOSE homework, evaluate the effect of spatial discretization by running the simulation with either 1 or 101 dendritic segments (see slide 17)
	Make g_pas smaller and Ra smaller if you do not see a difference between 1 and 101 segments.
