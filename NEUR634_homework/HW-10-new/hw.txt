Homework 10 [NEURON]
Model construction part of the assignment.
1. Create a ball and stick neuron 
	a. create a spherical soma and 100 um long dendrite Done!!!
	b. insert HHChannels in the soma, and pas in the dendrite Done!!!
	-c. you may use the code you wrote previously, but make sure no HHChannels in the dendrite
2. add synaptic connections to distal, middle and proximal dendrite
	a. Use ExpSyn, so we don't need a pre-synaptic neuron, with reversal potential of 0 mV Done!!!
	b. create three different NetStim objects Done!!!
	c. Use stim.number=1 Done!!!

Experimentation part of the model.
3. Determine the minimum synaptic weight (gmax) to produce an AP when 
	a. only the distal synapse is stimulated
	b. only the middle synapse is stimulated
	c. only the middle synapse is proximal
4. Does weight change if you increase stim.number?  
	a. make stim.number = 5, do you see 5 spikes using an interval of 10sm?
	b. decrease interval from the default of 10, to 1 (ms), how many spikes do you see?  can you decrease gmax and still see a spike?
