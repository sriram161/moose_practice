Homework:
1. Finishing up exercises from previous lecture
	A. output: Create function to create output tables [I eliminated this slide from the lectures until you have tried this yourself]
		DONE!!!
	B. run the 1 compartment simulation (use CM=0.01 F/m^2, adjust RM to obtain 10 ms time constant), but this time create an output graph.
	  DONE!!!
	C. clocks: adjust the simulation dt for your compartments (instructions in previous weeks lecture). Repeat simulations using 1 ms and 5 ms dt - do results differ from the default (5e-5) dt?
	  Yes! When simdt is 1mS and 5mS the traces has slight difference 1mS trace is at negative voltage near 0V and 5mS trace is at 0V.

2. dendrites and effects of subdividing into multiple compartments:
	A. add one dendrite to your model, with length = 100 microns and diameter = 2 microns
	   Done!!!
	B. create additional output: measure Vm in the "middle" of your dendrite
	C. connect the dendrite to the soma, and run simulation
	D. write function to subdivide the dendrite into X pieces
	E. use a loop to connect the dendritic pieces with one another (see slide 33 if you are having trouble)
	F. Use the function and the loop to create either 5 or 9 compartment models, measuring in the middle dendrite compartment.  Does Vm in the middle of the dendrite vary with the number of compartments?
