Homework:
1. Finishing up exercises from previous lecture
	A. output: Create function to create output tables [I eliminated this slide from the lectures until you have tried this yourself]
		DONE!!!
	B. run the 1 compartment simulation (use CM=0.01 F/m^2, adjust RM to obtain 10 ms time constant), but this time create an output graph.
	  DONE!!!
	C. clocks: adjust the simulation dt for your compartments (instructions in previous weeks lecture). Repeat simulations using 1 ms and 5 ms dt - do results differ from the default (5e-5) dt?
	  No difference in graphs when sim dt is changed.Cause tau >> 1ms and 5ms.

2. dendrites and effects of subdividing into multiple compartments:
	A. add one dendrite to your model, with length = 100 microns and diameter = 2 microns
	   Done!!!
	B. create additional output: measure Vm in the "middle" of your dendrite
	C. connect the dendrite to the soma, and run simulation
	   Done !!!
	D. write function to subdivide the dendrite into X pieces
	   Done !!!
	E. use a loop to connect the dendritic pieces with one another (see slide 33 if you are having trouble)
	   Done !!!
	F. Use the function and the loop to create either 5 or 9 compartment models, measuring in the middle dendrite compartment.  Does Vm in the middle of the dendrite vary with the number of compartments?

     No! voltage drop observed in the middle Compartment for 5 or 9 compartment model.
