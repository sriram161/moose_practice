Homework
1. Implement your channel from homework 6 in Neuron
	Either use channelbuilder to create your channel, or
	Download or edit a mod file, then re-compile neuron, as explained in class
2. Create a Model: soma + dendrite, with HH channels in the soma
3. Test the effect of your channel on spiking:
	a. insert your new channel into the model, either soma or dendrite, but not both)
	b. assign a conductance = 0 (e.g. soma.gmax_yourchannel=0)
	run simulation with current injection (you choose amplitude and duration of current, but produce spikes) - should like the same as when you did not have the channel inserted
	c. Assign a non-zero gbar value, run simulation (repeat for several gbar values. one small enough to produce almost no change, one large enough to produce significant change)
	d. Explain how the channel modifies spiking
