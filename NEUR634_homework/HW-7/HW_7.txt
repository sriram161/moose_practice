Homework
1. finish adding calcium concentration, a calcium channel and a calcium dependent potassium channel (SK) to your model.
    create calcium concentration. (ca_pool) Done!!!
    create calcium dependent potassium channel. (calcium dependent potassium channel) Done!!!
    connect calcium concentration with calcium dependent potassium channel. Done!!!
    create calcium channel. (ca alphabeta channel) Done!!!

	Include the calcium channel and SK channel in your dictionary of channel parameters Done!!!
    extend your chan_proto to create channels with Z gates Done!!!
    Create separate function for calcium concentration Done!!!

2. Add these to a single compartment model.
    Starting from a conductance of zero, increase the conductance of the calcium and SK channels until you see an effect.
    Describe how these channels affect spiking.

3. Add these to a multi-compartment model, either to multiple compartments or just the soma.

4. Think about your project.  If using MOOSE, do you have all the tools to implement the model you want to do?  As you create or modify your functions, think about writing them to facilitate implementing your project.
