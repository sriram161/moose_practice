For homework, rewrite or finish the code your wrote in class as follows:

1. place creation of compartment into function

Pass in parameters: compartment name, length and diameter
In the function: calculate Rm, Cm, create soma, assign values
Test on: Use CM=.03, RM=2.8e3, RA=4.0       SI units

2. place creation of pulsegen into function

Pass in parameters: compartment to connect to, duration and amplitude of current
In function: create pulsegen, assign values, connect to compartment

4. Main program: does everything else and calls the functions
Then, create a soma.  Inject current into and monitor the membrane potential every 10 ms or so.
