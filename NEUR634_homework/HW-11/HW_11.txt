Homework 11
1. Modify the ball and stick neuron to allow slightly different passive, sodium and potassium channel conductances
		customize biophysics in Class BallAndStick Done!!!
	Use the new class to create three neurons
		use random number generator to produce "small" difference in conductance Done!!!
		add small difference to conductances as shown on slides Done!!!
2. connect the three neurons in a ring Done!!!
	place synapse in middle of dendrite Done!!!
3. add one alphaSynapse, with onset=20ms and weight large enough to trigger an action potential Done!!!

4. Perform simulations with different amounts of variability
	a. make the variance zero - this eliminates variability.  Should see same regular firing as before customizing biophysics 
       Ans: python C:\Users\ksrir\Development\moose_practice\NEUR634_homework\HW-11\HW_11_ex_only.py 0 0
	b. try var=0.01: does this variance change the firing pattern?
       Ans: python C:\Users\ksrir\Development\moose_practice\NEUR634_homework\HW-11\HW_11_ex_only.py 0 0.01
       obs: No difference in firing pattern.
	c. try a high enough variance, e.g. 0.2, to disrupt regular firing (but do not allow conductance to be negative).
       Ans: python C:\Users\ksrir\Development\moose_practice\NEUR634_homework\HW-11\HW_11_ex_only.py 0 0.2
       obs: significant difference is firing pattern like difference in peak height, raise and fall time of AP.
	d. If you lower the weight of the netcon, do you see a bigger effect of variance?
        python C:\Users\ksrir\Development\moose_practice\NEUR634_homework\HW-11\HW_11_ex_only.py 0 0.2 0.01
5. go back to small or zero variance (somewhat regular firing); 
add in a inhibitory synapse with delay = 5 ms
	a. make the weight the same as excitatory synapses. 
    Does the inhibitory synapse change the period of firing (delay AP generation?).
    python C:\Users\ksrir\Development\moose_practice\NEUR634_homework\HW-11\HW_11_e_i.py 0 0 0.02 5 0.02 5
    obs: No it reduce the spiking activity.
